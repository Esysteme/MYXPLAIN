<p>Which indexes could be used to perform the query, these are <B>the potential indexes</B></p>
<p>Note that some of the indexes listed there could be useless because optimizer ignores the tables order displayed in the EXPLAIN output</p>
<p>The <i>possible_keys</i> and <i>key</i> columns are essential in the understanding of how the optimizer works</p>
<p>You should find one of the indexes listed there in the <i>key</i> column</p>
<p>If this is not the case, the trouble begins... hey, it's your job!</p>
<p>If NULL value is displayed, it is possible that an index is missing (or it means that you are looking to an UNION or a DERIVED TABLE row)</p>
<p>Remember to take a look at the <i>where</i> clause of the query to understand the optimizer choice</p>
